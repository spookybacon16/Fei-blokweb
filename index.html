			<p>* Monthly pricing is available when you select Apple Card Monthly Installments (ACMI) as payment type at
				checkout at Apple, and is subject to credit approval and credit limit. Financing terms vary by product.
				Taxes and shipping are not included in ACMI and are subject to your card’s variable APR. See the Apple
				Card Customer Agreement for more information. ACMI is not available for purchases made online at special
				storefronts. The last month’s payment for each product will be the product's purchase price, less all
				other payments at the monthly payment amount. ACMI financing is subject to change at any time for any
				reason, including but not limited to, installment term lengths and eligible products. See
				<a href="support.apple.com/kb/HT211204"></a> for information about upcoming changes to ACMI financing.

				it at checkout in the U.S. for eligible Apple products purchased at Apple Store locations, apple.com,

				See <a href="support.apple.com/kb/HT211204"></a> for more information about eligible products. APR
				ranges may vary
				based on when you accepted an Apple Card. Cardholders who accept an Apple Card on and/or after August
				10, 2023: Variable APRs for Apple Card, other than ACMI, range from 19.24% to 29.49% based on
				creditworthiness. Rates as of August 10, 2023. Existing cardholders: See your Customer Agreement for
				applicable rates and fee. If you buy an ACMI eligible product by choosing to pay in full with Apple Card
				(instead of using ACMI), that purchase is subject to the Apple Card variable APR, not 0% APR. Taxes and
				shipping on ACMI purchases are subject to the variable APR, not 0% APR. You’ll need to select AT&T,
				T‑Mobile, or Verizon as your carrier when you check out. An iPhone purchased with ACMI is always
				unlocked, so you can switch carriers at any time. ACMI is not available for purchases made online at the
				following special stores: Apple Employee Purchase Plan; participating corporate Employee Purchase
				Programs; Apple at Work for small businesses; Government, and Veterans and Military Purchase Programs,
				or on refurbished devices. The last month’s payment for each product will be the product’s purchase
				price, less all other payments at the monthly payment amount. ACMI financing is subject to change at any
				time for any reason, including but not limited to, installment term lengths and eligible products. See
				<a href="support.apple.com/kb/HT211204"></a> for information about upcoming changes to ACMI financing.

				when you accepted an Apple Card. Cardholders who accept an Apple Card on and/or after August 10, 2023:
				Variable APRs for Apple Card, other than ACMI, range from 19.24% to 29.49% based on creditworthiness.
				Rates as of August 10, 2023. Existing cardholders: See your Customer Agreement for applicable rates and
				fee. If you buy an ACMI-Eligible Product by choosing to pay in full with Apple Card (instead of using
				ACMI), that purchase is subject to the Apple Card variable APR, not 0% APR. Taxes and shipping on ACMI
				purchases are subject to the variable APR, not 0% APR. You'll need to select AT&T, T-Mobile, or Verizon
				as your carrier when you check out. An iPhone purchased with ACMI is always unlocked, so you can switch
				carriers at any time. ACMI is not available for purchases made online at the following special stores:
				Apple Employee Purchase Plan; participating corporate Employee Purchase Programs; Apple at Work for
				small businesses; Government, and Veterans and Military Purchase Programs, or on refurbished devices.
				The last month's payment for each product will be the product's purchase price, less all other payments
				at the monthly payment amount. ACMI financing is subject to change at any time for any reason, including
				but not limited to, installment term lengths and eligible products. See support.apple.com/kb/HT211204
				for information about upcoming changes to ACMI financing. See the Apple Card Customer Agreement for more
				information about ACMI financing. Apple Card is issued by Goldman Sachs Bank USA, Salt Lake City Branch.
				Available for qualifying applicants in the United States. If you reside in the U.S. territories, please
				call Goldman Sachs at 877-255-5923 with questions about accessing this offer or applying for Apple Card.
				Except for ACMI, this offer cannot be combined with other Apple promotions or financing offers that are
				directed to individual end-user customers in the Qualifying Location. This offer also cannot be combined
				with the Apple Employee Purchase Plan or business loyalty pricing. Some methods of payment are not
				accepted under this offer. See checkout for details. Additional restrictions apply. View full terms and
				conditions of offer here.
